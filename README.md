## Inspiration
XORSBLOCK is a simple 2D game that's made with Unity 4.6. It's my first game done with Unity, so it's a very meaningful experience! I am very interested in making games starting in high school, and has made a badminton game in my junior year. I followed a game tutorial called "Unity 2D-Game Development" by Ben Tristan; the instructor provides a structured tutorial of this game, but most of the details and graphic designs are made by me!

## What it does
It's a simple Block Breaker game. The player needs to smash all the blocks to win the game! There're many different kinds of blocks with different colors; each color represents a specific number of hits. The player needs to move the paddle with the mouse and makes sure that the ball doesn't fall under the paddle. Each level gives player three lives; if the ball falls under three times, then the player lost. If the player passes through all five levels, he/she wins the game.

## How I built it
It's built with Unity 4.6 and CSharp.
